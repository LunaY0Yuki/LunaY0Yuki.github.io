Hi! I am a first-year CS PhD student at Cornell Univeristy. I am currently a member of the <a href='https://portal.cs.cornell.edu/'>PoRTaL lab</a>, working with <a href='https://www.sanjibanchoudhury.com/'>Prof. Sanjiban Choudhury</a> on human-robot interaction.

I am particularily interested in high-level, long-horizon planning for robots. My current project involves researching methods to represent tasks efficiently and improve robots' ability to learn new tasks. 

I did my undergrad at Harvey Mudd College, where I did research in a wide range of areas: experimental airplane construction, underwater robotics, and human-robot interactions.
