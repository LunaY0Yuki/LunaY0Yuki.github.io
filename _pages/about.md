Hi! I am a third-year CS PhD student at Cornell Univeristy. I am currently a member of the <a href='https://portal.cs.cornell.edu/'>PoRTaL lab</a>, working with <a href='https://www.sanjibanchoudhury.com/'>Prof. Sanjiban Choudhury</a> on <i>how foundation models can help robots learn from interacting with humans</i>.

Foundation models are used in many ways, but I am particularly interested in how they can help robots learn from humans!

When humans learn to do tasks, we can watch others, ask questions, and improve based on feedback instead of simply relying on language instructions. My key insight is: robots should do the same; they can also benefit from (1) demonstrations, (2) online interactions, and (3) feedback when they need to learn new tasks and refine their behaviors.

I did my undergrad at Harvey Mudd College, where I did research in a wide range of areas: experimental airplane construction (<a href='https://www.hmc.edu/engineering/undergraduate-research-experiences/david-harris-research-group/'>@HMC Aero Lab</a>), underwater robotics (<a href='https://www.lair.hmc.edu/'>@LAIR</a>), and human-robot interactions(<a href='https://www.cs.hmc.edu/HEAT/'>@HEATlab</a>).
