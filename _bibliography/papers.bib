Unfortunately, current methods inadequately capture the uncertainty introduced by a lack of direct communication. This paper augments existing frameworks to introduce Simple Temporal Networks for Improvisational Teamwork (STN-IT)—a formulation that captures both the temporal dependencies and uncertainties between agents who need to coordinate but lack reliable communication. We define the notion of strong controllability for STN-ITs, which establishes a static scheduling strategy for controllable agents that produces a consistent team schedule, as long as non-communicative teammates act within known problem constraints. We provide both an exact and approximate approach for finding strongly controllable schedules, empirically demonstrate the trade-offs between these approaches on benchmarks of STN-ITs, and show analytically that the exact method is correct.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling}, author={Malia Morgan* and Julianna Schalkwyk* and \mkbibbold{Huaxiaoyue Wang*} and Hannah  Davalos and Ryan Martinez and Vibha Rohilla and James Boerkoel}, year={2022}, month={Jun.}, pages={261-269} }
